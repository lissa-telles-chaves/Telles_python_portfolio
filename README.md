Welcome! This repository shows the final deliverables I have for my elements of computing II class with Professor Smiley, to display the abilities I acquire throughout the class. 
# Project list
- First App:

- Tidy Data: https://github.com/lissa-telles-chaves/Telles_python_portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project
  
## First App
The app is an interactive tool to explore and visualize data from the "penguins.csv" dataset. It offers users an interface where they can access filtered information about penguins based on species and island characteristics!
You can select from dropdown options in the sidebar to filter the dataset by specific species and islands, allowing for dynamic interaction and exploration. The filtered results are then displayed, enabling users to discover more about the distribution of different penguin species.

## Tidy Data:
Here we reorganized data regarding who are the medalists of the 2008 Olympics into a more digestible dataframe and then proceeded to make an EDA to further help us understand the data.
