Welcome to my first project! This app was designed as an interactive tool to explore and visualize data from the "penguins.csv" dataset. It offers users an interface where they can access filtered information about penguins based on species and island characteristics! 

You can select from dropdown options in the sidebar to filter the dataset by specific species and islands, allowing for dynamic interaction and exploration. The filtered results are then displayed, enabling users to discover more about the distribution of different penguin species.

# 🐧 First App
Welcome to my first data app project! This app was designed as an interactive tool to explore and visualize data from the "penguins.csv" dataset. It offers users an interface where they can access filtered information about penguins based on species and island characteristics! 

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a beginner-friendly data exploration tool that allows users to see the data in an interactive manner.


## 🚀 How to Run This App
1- Clone this repository
2- Install the required dependencies
3- Launch the app
4- Explore the app: Use the sidebar dropdown menus to filter by species and island. The resulting filtered table will appear on the main screen.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset used is penguins.csv, which contains data on penguin species observed in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

Key features include:
- Species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
- Island (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)
- Measurements like bill length, flipper length, and body mass

Pre-processing steps:
The dataset is read directly from the data/ directory.
No major cleaning was applied; the data is used as-is for simple filtering.
